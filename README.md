# Printable Flashcard Generator

## Features

### Log in with Google

If you want to save your flashcards, you can log in with Google. This also allows you to add more words to a set of
flashcards with images. This is good if you want to create multi-language flashcards.

### Exclude Images

If you already have the images printed out, you can check the "Exclude Images" box to skip the image PDF generation.

### Paste Copied Image

You can paste an image from you clipboard by clicking the "Paste" button next to the image input. This is useful if you
want to quickly add an image without having to save it to your computer first.
